# 2019OfficialRelease
Ready for the game "Destination Deep Space"
Our Robot's name is "Boreas" honoring mentors Bruce, and Bob. It also stands for the Greek god of winter/cold.
Boreas has an arm, a jack, cams, a lift, and a 6-wheel drivetrain. Each one (except for the lift) is operated by a TalonSRX.
The lift is operated by a NEO Brushless motor. 
There are limit switches for the NEO, but otherwise, the Talons that have encoders have breakoutboards so that limits don't need code


@Author's Final Note to the team:

Both the students and mentors on this team (With a few exceptions) are terrible. 

Mentors, you're stubborn and restricting. The students are capable, and don't need the amount of handholding (or at least the type you enforce), especially on the business side. Students are at least capable of what they do. You need to be supportive of our decisions, even if they are bad decisions at times. That's how we learn. Also, let the students have fun. "Professionals" are allowed to have humor.

Students, you're an exclusive and discouraging group. I have no reason to be on this team apart from code. I wanted at one point to do more. I know I could do more, and some of you see that, but I really was not allowed the chance to. I got stuck with only code, and even in code, I have been degraded for the past 3 years by students without change. I didn't ask to be blamed for so many mechanical and electrical problems while being made fun of as if I'm some incompetent fool. "Blame Programming", or any one group is such a toxic thing for any team (you know who you are if you do it), far more than "Business can raise more money". At least you guys act to have faith in business. You are directly insulting me and the things I love to do. I know I insult people, and I do it moreso out of in the moment stress. If you've known me though, throwing insults is a lot better than what I used to do. It's no excuse though.

The stress goes beyond just what happens during build. I personally hate a lot of you, and from what I can tell, you hate me as well. I could not even make the one friend I wanted to on the team because your intimidation prevented it from happening (again, you know who you are). I might have been happier with a friend to go to, but that's too late. It's really too late for anything now. I tried to fix a lot of early personal problems I caused, albeit sheepishly, but there was no settling, no talking, and certainly no healing. Like an untreated wound, this problem got worse over time.

I plan to leave this team after this year's (2020's) 1st competition, regardless of if we make the world or state championships.

I really hope that this is not the case forever. I do not want other students to feel as I have with robotics. It is really only these problems with the team I mentioned. Hopefully these problems are fixed and soon.

I'm no exception to these problems though, and hopefully I have less of a reason to have the next set of peers hate me so much. I've been working on some of my own qualities, but due to such a set view of me, I got no chance to show it. I'm sorry to those I mistreated, but saying sorry, nor did anything I tried, fix anything.
